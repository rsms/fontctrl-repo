## Publishing

There are two ways of publishing your fonts:

1. Add your font to an existing repository
2. Setup your own repository


## Adding your font to an existing repository

If your font is free, as in free to distribute, then you can
[submit a request](https://github.com/rsms/fontctrl-web/issues/new) to have your
fonts added to the main fontctrl-maintained repository.

You can also of course get in touch with someone who hosts and alternative
repository.

When distributing commercial fonts, it's better to setup your own repository
in order to limit access.


## Hosting your own repository

Hosting your own repository is as simple as getting some files up on a web
server. There are many ways of doing this and is generally pretty easy to do.

Say you are a design team using a set of fonts, some commercial that you all
have licensed for and perhaps some non-commercial, "libre" fonts. Setting up
a repository for your team means that everyone will have the same font versions
installed, and whenever you add a new typeface to your repertoire, everyone
gets it automatically.

Hosting your own repository also makes sense if you are distributing commerical
fonts, in which case you can provide access to fonts on a per-user-account
basis.
